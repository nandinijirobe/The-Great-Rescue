# 🐱 THE GREAT RESCUE 🦸

## Overview
My project is based on a short story. When a man finds out that a cat is stuck in a tree in the mountains, he leaves his house to go rescue it. He travels across the river on a boat and climbs through the mountains day and night until he finds the cat. He then takes the happy cat home in a hot air balloon to take care of it.

Each part of the landscape in this project is made with different shades of color so it looks like a pixelated picture.This project was developed using Python and Python Turtle Graphics! 🐍🐢
